# vrisingsimpleserver

## General Information
I got mad at having to manage VRising Servers and made this! Its written in python with the only needed part being PyQt5, with pyinstaller to package it all up at the end



## Usage
Snag a released version from releases. Unzip the files, there should be two, the manager and the settings.json. On first launch you will be required to name your server, past that hit start and needed files will be downloaded.


## Already Existing servers
You can 100% plug in already existing servers to this, just open the settings.json either in the manager, or in your favorite text editor and change where they point to.
